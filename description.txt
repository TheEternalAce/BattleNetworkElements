Elements of Terraria, initially introduced by Shards of Atheria, implements a new immersive elemental mechanic to Terraria!
There are four elements that any NPC, weapon or projectile can have: Fire, Ice, Electric, andMetal. 
The elemental system is based on a strength and weakness system, akin to rock-paper-scissors, Fire is effective against Ice, Ice is effective against Metal, Metal is effective against Electric, and Electric is effective against Fire.
