Elements of Terraria, initially introduced by Shards of Atheria, implements a new immersive elemental mechanic to Terraria!
There are four elements that any NPC, weapon or projectile can have: Fire, Aqua, Electric, and Wood. 
The elemental system is based on a multiplier system.
When an NPC or Player takes damage, the damage is multiplied by the element multiplier for the corresponding element.

For example:
A Blue Slime's multipliers are as follows, Fire: 2.0x, Aqua: 0.8x, Electric: 0.5x, Wood: 1.0x.
Damaging the slime with an Fire weapon will double the damage.
Damaging the slime with an Aqua weapon will reduce the damage by 20%.
Damaging the slime with an Electric weapon will reduce the damage by 50%.
Damaging the slime with a Fire AND Aqua weapon will increase the damage by 60%.
Damaging the slime with a Wood weapon will deal normal damage.

The mod adds only one item which shows the holder's elemental multipliers.
