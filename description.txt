Elements of Terraria, initially introduced by Shards of Atheria, implements a new immersive elemental mechanic to Terraria!
There are four elements that any NPC, weapon or projectile can have: Fire, Ice, and Electric. 
The elemental system is based on a multiplier system.
When an NPC or Player takes damage, the damage is multiplied by the element multiplier for the corresponding element.

For example:
A Blue Slime's multipliers are as follows, Fire: 2.0x, Ice: 0.8x, Electric: 0.5x.
Damaging the slime with an Fire weapon will double the damage.
Damaging the slime with an Ice weapon will reduce the damage by 20%.
Damaging the slime with an Electric weapon will reduce the damage by 50%.
Damaging the slime withe a Fire AND Ice weapon will increase the damage by 60%.

This mod adds no content, other than the mechanic, it simply creates a foundation for other mods to add cool stuff.
